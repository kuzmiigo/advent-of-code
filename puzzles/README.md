# Puzzles

This directory contains puzzles downloaded from
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for easier offline access.

To add new puzzles:

1. Create a new directory, like `puzzles/2022`.
2. Save source of the index and day pages in that directory in files
   `index.html`, `01.html`, ... `25.html` (use two digits).
3. Run `../fix.sh *.html` to fix links and remove unnecessary tags.
